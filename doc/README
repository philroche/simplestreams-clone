== Simple Sync Format ==
Simple Sync format consists of 2 different file formats.
 * content stream: A collection of multiple item groups of the same "type".
 * stream collection: a list of content streams
   A stream collection is simply a way to provide an index of known content
   streams, and information about them.

Useful definitions
 * item group
   an item group is a list of like items. Ie, all produced by the same build.
   requirements:
    * serial: a 'serial' entry that can be sorted by YYYYMMDD[.X]
    * items: a list of items

   Example item groups are:
    * output of the amd64 cloud image build done on 2012-04-04
    * amd64 images from the cirros release version 0.3.1

 * item
   There are 1 or more items in a item group.
   requirements:
    * name: must be unique within the item group.

   special fields:
    * path: If an item has a 'path', then the target must be obtainable and
      should be downloaded when mirroring.
    * md5sum: stores checksum

   Example:
    * "disk1.img" produced from the amd64 cloud image build done on 2012-04-04
    * -root.tar.gz produced from the same build.

== Stream ==
format: stream-1.0
examples:  doc/example/amd64.yaml doc/example/i386.yaml

Requirements:
 * must have an 'iqn' entry at top level that uniquely identifies this stream.

Notes:
 * if an item has a 'path' element, that indicates there is a file
   to be downloaded at the 'path' location.
   path is required to be relative to the mirror root.
 * in the event of a 404 or ENOENT on a PATH, the client will consult the 
   'mirrors' entry in the MIRROR.info file, and try to resolve the file
   from *that* mirror.

== Mirror ==
Requirements:
 * top level MIRROR.info file
   That file is required to define an 'iqn', that indicates what it is
   a mirror of, and should contain a 'authoritative_url' indicating
   the upstream mirror for that.
   iqn is used so a client can easily maintain a list of mirrors not
   by 'authoritative_url' but by iqn.
   iqn cannot contain /.
 * v1/streams

Optional:
 * v1/streams.js v1/streams.js.gpg
   Contains same content as v1/streams
 * v1/streams/unsigned
 * A mirror is required to have a MIRROR.info file at its top level.
